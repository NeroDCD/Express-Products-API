# Project Overview

This project is built as part of my exploration into creating a RESTful CRUD API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, following a series of comprehensive video tutorials by **Devtamin**. The tutorials cover the entire process of building a robust API, from setting up the server to connecting with a MongoDB database, and handling various CRUD operations.
